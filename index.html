                    <p id="p1"><span class="t">T</span>
                        oday, we are proud to announce that the Shine app has <a href="https://www.headspacehealth.com/press-release/shine"> been acquired</a>
                        by Headspace Health.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        When we started Shine 6 years ago, we were frustrated by the lack of representation and inclusion in the mental health category. Naomi and I didn’t often see our identities as women of color, our socioeconomic backgrounds or even our body types represented in mainstream wellness.
                    </p>
                    <p>And there were so many others with that same experience. We quickly discovered: people who identified as Black, Native American, Hispanic, Asian and/or LGBTQIA+—we all had higher rates of anxiety and depression, and fewer options for inclusive care.</p>
                    <p>
                        While that gap still persists today, so much has changed in 6 short years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shine has become a meaningful leader in the movement for inclusive mental health—receiving recognition from Apple as Best of 2018 and 2020, Google as Standout Wellbeing App, and the American Psychological Association for Best App for People of Color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the Shine app, we created and scaled a new model for culturally competent care—Equitable Mental Healthcare, growing to 6M people in our community who largely identify as BIPOC and LGBTQIA+.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most importantly, we felt Shine’s impact from that community first-hand, with 1 in 3 reviews calling Shine “life-changing”—with many members noting how much it meant to them to feel “seen” and “represented” in their mental health journey, often for the first time.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, Headspace evolved from a meditation company to a full-service mental health company through a merger with <a href="https://www.ginger.com/">Ginger</a> last year. And one of the top priorities of the combined organization, Headspace Health, has been to build the world’s most inclusive mental health and wellbeing brand.</p>
                    <p>We’ve watched them prioritize building a diverse workforce, invest in cultural competency and create content that supports underrepresented communities.</p>
                    <p>Headspace Health is now able to support people from all backgrounds—with care that spans the spectrum, from daily meditation and mindfulness to on-demand behavioral health coaching, therapy and psychiatry.</p>
                    <p>We know the fight for equity in mental health will take all of us.</p>
                    <p>We are so proud to join forces with Headspace Health to make that shared vision a reality.</p>
                    <p>This moment wouldn’t be possible without the incredible, talented Shine team, our dedicated investors, partners and advisors, and most importantly—our members.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for believing in Shine, for letting us be a part of your own journey, and for playing a pivotal role in the movement for inclusive mental health.</p>
                    <p>Our work is only getting started.</p>

                    <p><strong>What’s the big news?</strong></p>
